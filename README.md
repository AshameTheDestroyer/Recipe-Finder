# Recipe-Finder

A website about food and recipes, to extend my knowledge and understandability about fetch APIs, TS, SCSS/SASS, and also this time Redux, and to my current conclusion, it sucks, let's see how this changes over the progress of the project.

### v1. Header & Modals
I'll admit it, I'm so dumb and busy I forgot to name this one as the First Commit as always, but anyways…
The header is mostly done, with a nice search bar, and a theme toggle button, also with sign up and in buttons that lead you to Modals containing forms that you can sign up or in!
Managing modals was fun to do, and learning about them and Portals in general was a great choice, I'm looking at you Redux…
