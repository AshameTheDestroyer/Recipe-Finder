# Recipe-Finder

A website about food and recipes, to extend my knowledge and understandability about fetch APIs, TS, SCSS/SASS, and also this time Redux, and to my current conclusion, it sucks, let's see how this changes over the progress of the project.

### v1. Header & Modals
I'll admit it, I'm so dumb and busy I forgot to name this one as the First Commit as always, but anyways…
The header is mostly done, with a nice search bar, and a theme toggle button, also with sign up and in buttons that lead you to Modals containing forms that you can sign up or in!
Managing modals was fun to do, and learning about them and Portals in general was a great choice, I'm looking at you Redux…

### v2. Recipe Displayer
I've made it so that the recipes get displayed in two ways, one horizontally for mobiles, and vertically for desktops and tablets, and it looks kinda cool.

### v3. Recipe Information Section
Now the recipes that you select can be displayed in a way to show further more information, and some fixes.

### v4. The Missing Pieces
I've been so crowded with universities and self-studying, that I barely had the time to work on this project anymore, but indeed after more than a month, I finally managed to develop most of the features I wanted in the first place, and currently, the project is kinda well-done, and I'm proud of it, and wish to continue on other projects, because this one took more than it should.
BTW I remembered, this pulling request's name is actually inspired by the part 2 of Horimiya :P.
